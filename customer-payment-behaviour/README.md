# Accounts Receivables Collection Efficacy

Companies are increasingly worried about if and when their customers will pay their bills. Can you predict with accuracy if a customer will pay their bill on time?

## Dataset

The data contains information about the payment behaviour of a company's customers. This can be found in the `dataset.csv` file with the appropriate labels in the first row. It can be used to predict whether a customer will pay their bill on time, and which customers are likely to pay faster. This is crucial to most companies as they need to optimise their collection efforts.

## Guidance

This is not an exhaustive list of tasks, the points are provided in order to guide you:

### Correlations and Relationships
Identify any correlations between the provided parameters and the payment speed of a customer. If you find any interesting correlations, visualise them in a library of your choice.

### Model
Build a robust model, logistic regression, decision tree, or another one of your choice. Use half of the data to train your model, and the second half to test its accuracy. What is the highest AUC you can get?

### Interpretation
Describe what affects the quality of your model, and what affects the likelihood of a customer to pay on time. Can you provide recommendations to the company based on your chosen models?
