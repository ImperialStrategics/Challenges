# Churn Prediction

## Background

Most customer serving businesses allocate a great deal of their expenses to acquire new customers. While acquiring new customers is generally extremely costly keeping them might not be as expensive. Therefore these businesses need to predict which customers are going to stop using their services or as they call it 'churn' so that they can act upon it. Your task in this challenge is to predict if a specific customer is likely to churn and also to give an insight what generally indicates churning so that companies can see where they need to improve their services.

## Dataset

This dataset contains data from a phone service provider and is acquired from [IBM Analytics Communities](https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/guide-to-sample-datasets/)

The dataset is provided in a simple `.csv` file. It is recommended to use the Python packages `numpy` and `pandas` to read and manipulate the data. Choice of programming language is not restricted, however Imperial Strategics & Data Science Society projects/workshops are in Python.

## Guidance

This is not an exhaustive list of tasks, the points are provided in order to guide you:

### Understanding the Data

There are various of types of data in the dataset you will need to find a way to unify them. Can you also see which features might be correlated? You might also need to do some hand engineering at this stage.

### Feature Selection & Engineering

Select the most predictive features in the model. This can also give you an insight into general strategical changes this particular business needs to implement to stay profitable.

### Model

Select an appropriate model and tune it to improve its performance.

### Evaluation

Report your results using appropriate metrics and explain key decisions in your process. Suggest possible improvements. Also suggest a way for the business to improve their management strategy.
