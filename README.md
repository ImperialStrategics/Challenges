# Challenges

Pre-interview problems for incoming team members 2018-2019


## Datasets

Choose and work on **one** of the challenges provided above. You can assume the data is all correctly labelled and cleaned. The details of each challenge are found in the `README.md` file in the respective folder.


## Assessment

Submissions are assessed on the following criteria:

### Assumptions

Before choosing a model, state your assumptions and reasoning for doing so. This will enable us to understand your thought process. Some of these problems (such as the churn prediction task) have many different outcomes, dependent on the assumptions made.

### Interpretation

Briefly summarise the goal of your chosen challenge and an abstract of your analysis. You may use mathematical/well-accepted notation over long sentences if you feel its much easier to explain concepts. More concise is better!

### Model Selection & Validation

We have **relaxed requirements** when it comes to the optimality of the final model because tasks may require high compute power. **We are much more interested in the process of your approach**, which should come with developed and explained solutions.

### Visualizations & Statistics

Deep analysis of each dataset is not provided, so you have more freedom in researching around the subject and can create your own interpretations. Key visuals and stats are highly encouraged, however **do not** spend more than a few lines of code trying to generate the perfect graph.


## Submissions

### Format

Compress your solution and send the `.zip` or `.tar` file via [email](mailto:icdss@imperial.ac.uk). The subject line should follow:

```
Data Science Challenge: <challenge_name>_<imperial_login>
```

Your `imperial_login` should be your Imperial College username (e.g. `abc12`). Please note **you must be a member of the** [ICDSS society](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/activities/a-to-z/data-science), it is **free!**

### Language

Any programming language is allowed as long as you provide an easy way to setup the environment on MacOS or Ubuntu Desktop so we can reproduce your results. Please specify in the email if you have a preference between the two platforms.

### Deliverables

You can choose to submit a **Jupyter Notebook** or a **PDF**. If you choose PDF we also require documented scripts to reproduce the results. There is no fixed structure for the report and it can look like a presentation if you wish.

**We prefer quality of quantity, a perfectly good report could be comprised of a few slides & Jupyter workbook**

### CV

Please include a copy of your CV within your email, specifically highlighting your Data Science experience/projects.
