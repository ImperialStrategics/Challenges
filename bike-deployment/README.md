# Churn Prediction

## Background

Bikeshare services are being introduced around the worlds' major cities with privately owned companies gaining traction in the last couple years. In this challenge you will have to aid such a buisness with their expansion strategy.

## Dataset

This dataset contains data about bikes of a bikeshare business operation in and around Manhattan, New York and was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/samratp/bikeshare-analysis)

The dataset is provided in a simple `.csv` file. It is recommended to use the Python packages `numpy` and `pandas` to read and manipulate the data. Choice of programming language is not restricted, however Imperial Strategics & Data Science Society projects/workshops are in Python.

## Guidance

This is not an exhaustive list of tasks, the points are provided in order to guide you:

### Understanding the Data

One visualization is provided in the example code but it might be useful to do exploratory analysis to understand the data better.

### Propose Expansion Strategy

This company is looking to expand its fleet by 200 bikes. Suggest where they should install their stations and what size these stations should be(number of bikes). Back up your reasoning with the available data. It might be useful to employ algorithmic optimization for this.
